//  Runtime-tunable knobs for the MLX inference path.
//
//  Today the only knob is `mlxBatchEngineMaxBatchSize` — `BatchEngine` is the
//  single MLX entry point (no per-request `TokenIterator` fallback) and the
//  prior osaurus-side scheduler / cooperative-yield / multi-stream gates have
//  all been retired. Their behaviour is now provided by vmlx-swift-lm's actor
//  loop (see `vmlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/BatchEngine/BATCH_ENGINE.md`).

    /// §8 + §15 invariant 13: compile only engages when `maxBatchSize == 1`
    /// (Stage 1B.4 — per-bucket shared `[B, H, maxLen, D]` buffers — is

    ///   `defaults write ai.osaurus ai.osaurus.scheduler.mlxBatchEngineMaxBatchSize -int 8`
    ///
    /// — at the cost of compile being permanently disabled for that
    /// process. The rate-display rolling tok/s ramp + tooltip alert
    /// surfaces this trade-off in the chat UI when a non-default value is
    /// detected.
