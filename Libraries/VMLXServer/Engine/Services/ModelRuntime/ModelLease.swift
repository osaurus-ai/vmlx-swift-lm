//  ModelLease.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  Refcounted leases on loaded model names. Acts as the single source of truth
//  for "this model is in use right now, do not unload it" so that GC paths,
//  strict eviction, and manual unload all funnel through the same gate.
//
//  Without this, an in-flight MLX generation can have its weights/buffers
//  freed mid-stream and the next Metal command buffer submission crashes with
//  `notifyExternalReferencesNonZeroOnDealloc` (the Metal command buffer still
//  references freed AGXG buffers).
//
//  Lease lifetime is tied to the lifetime of a single generation stream:
//  acquired right after `loadContainer` succeeds and released when the gated
//  generation task completes (on success, throw, or cancellation).
//
