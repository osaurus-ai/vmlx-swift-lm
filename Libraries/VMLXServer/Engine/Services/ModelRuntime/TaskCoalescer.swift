//  Generic single-flight cache for async resource creation. Concurrent
//  callers requesting the same key all observe the same in-flight `Task`
//  and therefore the same returned value. Used by
//  `MLXBatchAdapter.Registry` to avoid building a duplicate `BatchEngine`
//  on the same MLX `ModelContainer`, which would put two consumers on the
//  shared GPU command queue and surface as Metal completion-queue
//  abort (`MTLReleaseAssertionFailure`).

import Foundation

/// Single-flight cache: at most one creator per key is in flight at a
/// time, every concurrent caller observes the same resolved value.
///
/// Construction-order invariant inside `value(for:factory:)`:
///   1. Park the in-flight `Task` in `creating[key]` *before* awaiting it,
///      so any caller that lands while the actor is suspended in
///      `await task.value` finds the task and joins instead of starting
///      a second creation.
///   2. After the await, write `values[key] = value` *before* clearing
///      `creating[key]`. A caller that lands between these two writes
///      either observes the resolved value (cache hit) or the still-set
///      in-flight task (joins the same task) — never the empty state
///      that would trigger a second creation.
///
/// Removal discipline (the `remove(_:)` / `removeAll()` direction):
///
/// `remove(_:)` and `removeAll()` must atomically (a) take exclusive
/// ownership of the in-flight `Task` so concurrent removers cannot
/// double-drain the same value (which would cause the caller to
/// double-shutdown the underlying resource), AND (b) keep the task
/// observable to concurrent `value(for:)` callers so they can join the
/// drain instead of starting a duplicate factory while the actor is
/// suspended on `await creation.value`.
///
/// The two requirements are met by moving the task from `creating[key]`
/// (which `value(for:)`'s start-new-task path keys off) into
/// `draining[key]` (which `value(for:)`'s join path also keys off).
/// First remover wins the move; the second remover finds `creating[key]`
/// nil and falls through to `values.removeValue(forKey:)`, which is
/// also nil during the drain — so the second remover gets `nil`.
///
/// **Removal-race invariant**: between the post-await resume of
/// `value(for:)` and its `values[key] = …` write, a concurrent
/// `remove(_:)` / `removeAll()` may have transferred the task to
/// `draining`. The canonicality check (`creating[key] == ourTask`)
/// then fails (since the slot is empty), so `value(for:)` does not
/// commit a stale entry the user just asked to remove.
