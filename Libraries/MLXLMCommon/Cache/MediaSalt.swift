// Media salt: a stable fingerprint of VLM image/video/audio inputs for cache keying.
//
// Problem
// -------
// The multi-tier cache coordinator keys its lookups by the flat text token list.
// For VLMs, the model replaces placeholder `<image>` tokens with the vision
// tower's output embeddings during forward pass — so the same token prefix
// with a different image produces different KV state. Naive text-only keying
// would yield false-positive cache hits with the wrong KV for image positions,
// which is why `TokenIterator.init` historically bypassed the cache entirely
// whenever `input.image != nil || input.video != nil`.
//
// Bypassing the cache is extremely expensive: every turn of a multi-turn VLM
// chat re-runs the full vision tower AND re-prefills every prior text token,
// even though neither has changed. On Gemma 4 VLM at 2K context that's
// hundreds of milliseconds to seconds of wasted work per turn.
//
// Fix
// ---
// Compute a SHA256 fingerprint of the raw pixel/audio bytes + shape + dtype of
// any image/video/audio input, and pass it alongside the token list to the cache tiers.
// Each tier mixes the salt into its internal hash (same way modelKey is
// mixed), so "same text prefix + same image" cache-hits while "same text +
// different image" misses, as required.
//
// The salt is computed once per TokenIterator init, stored on the iterator,
// and reused at store time. Cost: one SHA256 pass over the pixel tensor
// (~a few milliseconds for a typical 448x448 image), negligible vs vision
// tower forward (~100 ms).

///
/// Returns `nil` when the input has no image, video, or audio — callers can
/// then fall through the cache coordinator exactly as they did for text-only
/// inputs, preserving byte-for-byte behavior on text-only paths.
///
/// The fingerprint is a lowercase hex SHA256 of:
/// - The literal UTF-8 tag `"image:"` (if an image is present) followed by
///   shape, dtype, and raw contiguous pixel bytes
/// - The literal UTF-8 tag `"video:"` (if a video is present) followed by
///   shape, dtype, and raw contiguous pixel bytes
/// - The literal UTF-8 tag `"audio:"` (if audio is present) followed by
///   sample rate, shape, dtype, and raw contiguous waveform bytes
///
/// Shape + dtype are hashed before bytes so different-shaped tensors with
/// identical bytes never collide. Ordering is deterministic: image before
/// video. The `frames: [THW]?` field is ignored because it is recoverable
/// from the pixel tensor shape.
///
/// Thread-safety: safe to call concurrently; CryptoKit's SHA256 is
/// value-typed and the underlying MLXArray reads are via `asData` which
/// takes a read-only snapshot.
